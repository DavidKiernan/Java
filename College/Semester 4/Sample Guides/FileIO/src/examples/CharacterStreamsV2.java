// The second version of the program below shows how the try with resources 
// feature of Java 7 can make the code a lot simpler. By specifying the 
// resources being used at the start of the try block you can get rid of 
// the finally block altogether as the FileReader and FileWriter streams 
// will be closed automatically.  It means you don't have to worry about 
// closing the input and output streams manually and the resources will 
// always be freed up.
